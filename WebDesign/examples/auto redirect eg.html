<H1>REDIRECTION EXAMPLE</H1>
<p>
This web page is set to audtomatically re-direct itself to Slate Magazine's home page 8 seconds after it loads. The idea is to allow enough time to read this, which would typically be a message to say something like</p>
<p align="center">This web page has moved to blah blah blah; you will be taken there in a moment. Please update your bookmarks
</p>
<p>In this example there is no good reason at all why I chose Slate</p>
<p>You'll want to see the source of this page to see how it works - copy just the third line, or, if you're quick enough, copy this to paste into your document immediately after the &lt;HEAD> tag:</p>
<p align="center">
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=REFRESH CONTENT="8;URL=http://www.slate.com/">
</p>
<p>where the <b>10</b> is the delay in seconds and the url is where it gets redirected.</p>
