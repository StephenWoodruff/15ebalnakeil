 <br />The css code is this:
<pre>
.backwards {
font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, Arial; Lucida, Sans-Serif;
font-size:1.5em ;
color: #800000;
unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
direction: rtl;
}
</pre>
then replace the &#64; sign with its code, which is &amp;#64;
<br/>
The html code on your page would be this:

<p>Why not email me at &lt;span

class="backwards">moc.niamodelpmaxe&amp;#64;uoy&lt;/span></p>
<p>
Your code contains <i>moc.niamodelpmaxe&amp;#64;uoy</i> so any bot looking at the source sees that nonsense, and not an email address, whereas the user at a screen sees <i>you@example.com</i> which crucially  doesn't appear anywhere in the code.

</p>
Examples:
<br />
Here it is <span class="backwards">moc.niamodelpmaxe&#64;uoy</span> inside a span. A span takes up just the space it needs, so looks OK on the page.
<br />
If you don't put it in a span it will be right-justified on the page (as its right-to-left text) so if it were in a paragraph, for example, you'd need to add text-align:left; to the style sheet to avoid it looking like this: <p class="backwards">moc.niamodelpmaxe&#64;uoy</p>
which is in its own paragraph.
