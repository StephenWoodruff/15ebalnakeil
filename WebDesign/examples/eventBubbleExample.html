<h1>Event Bubbling</h1>
<p>When you put an event in a tag, for example  &lt;p onClick="alert('You clicked a paragraph');"&gt; which tags get and handle the event? Every tag is inside at least one (&lt;body&gt;) other tag, and unless a handling element explicitly deals with an event it can continue to "bubble up" to the enclosing elements. This illustrates what happens: try clicking in different places, and try it in different browsers.
